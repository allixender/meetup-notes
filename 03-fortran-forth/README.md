# Introduction to Fortran and Forth

Benson Muite, 9 November 2017

In this meetup Benson gave us a little introduction to Fortran and Forth,
two arcane, almost ancient programming languages,
yet Fortran is still very much alive and used in a variety of high-performance computing (HPC) scenarios.

You can use command line and a simple text editor (vi, emacs, nano, gedit, atom, notepad++, kate).
For the faint-hearted Atom ( https://atom.io/ ) has most of the features we might need for this session, is open and cross platform.

Try Fortran out with a Gnu Fortran GCC installed and maybe even Eclipse Fortran IDE:
