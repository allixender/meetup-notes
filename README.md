We are changing our name to The Tartu GeoCode, in particular to reflect, that we want to look into geospatial data and technologies, location-based services, GIS, smart city and IoT - really linking code and geo. Our meetup is open to practitioners regardless of level, age, gender, or job. All interested humans, story tellers, programmers, casual hackers, juniors and seasoned developers are welcome to take part. Students, testers, project managers, analysts, or technical and non-technical folks are certainly invited, too.
