- 14/09/2017 [Basic Play Java](https://github.com/allixender/meetup-notes/tree/master/01-play-java-starter)
- 12/10/2017 [Python Jupyter](https://github.com/allixender/meetup-notes/tree/master/02-python-jupyter)
- 09/11/2017 [Fortran Forth](https://github.com/allixender/meetup-notes/tree/master/03-fortran-forth)

We are changing our name to The Tartu GeoCode, in particular to reflect, that we want to look into geospatial data and technologies, location-based services, GIS, smart city and IoT - really linking code and geo. Our meetup is open to practitioners regardless of level, age, gender, or job. All interested humans, story tellers, programmers, casual hackers, juniors and seasoned developers are welcome to take part. Students, testers, project managers, analysts, or technical and non-technical folks are certainly invited, too.

- 02/05/2019 [Open and Free Geodata](https://kodu.ut.ee/~kmoch/SpaceTech_2019_open_geodata/)

We supported the data workshop "Where can I get free data about Earth, and what can I do with it?" event at the SPARK HUB Demo, 17:30-21:00, (Narva mnt. 3, Tartu), which was for everyone to know extra tools and background to get a head start for the Garage48 SpaceTech 2019 hackathon on the weekend (where I also attended as mentor). This data workshop is organized together with Tartu Teaduspark, ESA BIC Estonia and Garage48.

- 27/01/2020 [Earth Observation activities in Estonia](https://kodu.ut.ee/~kmoch/eo_edu_quo_vadis/)

We had the opportunity to controbute to Mobile Monday Space edition Vol. 2 with our perspective on "Earth Observation education and training activities in Estonia: Quo vadis?" at the SPARK HUB Demo, 18:00-21:00, (Narva mnt. 3, Tartu).
