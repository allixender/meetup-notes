GeoPandas intro
===============

http://geopandas.org/index.html

GeoPandas is an open source project to make working with geospatial data in python easier.
GeoPandas extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types.
Geometric operations are performed by shapely.
Geopandas further depends on fiona for file access and descartes and matplotlib for plotting.

We will need some Excel Python libs:

```shell
(py34) conda install xlrd
```

Maybe we also need "openpyxl", but let's try to not mix too many libs for same/similar purposes.
