    "\n",
    "In this meetup we want to play with the \n",
    "Jupyter Notebook (http://jupyter.org/) and do some data \n",
    "wrangling with Python, Pandas (http://pandas.pydata.org/) and co.,\n",
    "some data analysis and visualisation.\n",

    "## Preparations\n",
    "\n",
    "Miniconda is an encapsulated versatile virtual python environment installer, \n",
    "that works under the hood of the big Anaconda python distribution.\n",
    "Miniconda is basically a mini version of Anaconda that includes only the conda package manager and its dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://conda.io/miniconda.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3.6, 64-bit (exe installer)\n",
    "https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe\n",
    "\n",
    "BEWARE:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To install miniconda SYSTEM-WIDE for ALL users, this does require administrator permissions; \n",
    "  every users can then create their own environments with the conda tool.\n",
    "- Please do NOT make Conda the default python for the system if you don't want it to interfere with other Python installations you might have,\n",
    "  eg. Pythons of ArcGIS and QGis etc\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional install information:\n",
    "https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating environments and install components\n",
    "\n",
    "How to use the conda command? Open the Anaconda/conda command prompt from the Start menu:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda create` basically represents a typical Python virtualenv command.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://conda.io/docs/_downloads/conda-cheatsheet.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to use a Python version 3.4 because some of the libraries/tools we want to work with supposedly only are supported up to Python 3.4.\n",
    "Here it becomes obvious how practical virtual environments can be. They help you to keep various Python versions around without messing up your system.\n",
    " \n",
    "```shell\n",
    "(C:\\dev\\conda3) conda create --name py34 python=3.4\n",
    "\n",
    "and then show all environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "#> conda env list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we want to activate that environment and start working with it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "activate py34\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "(py34) conda install jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "latest: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.20.3/index.html (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "0.19.2 (used by Geopandas): http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.19.2/\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "(py34) conda install pandas=0.19.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started with the Jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, \n",
    "equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, \n",
    "data visualization, machine learning, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the full Meetup-Repositiry from https://github.com/allixender/meetup-notes/archive/master.zip and \n",
    "extract it to a LOCAL folder.\n",
    "Go back into the console/commandline prompt and change into that folder. There you should then start the Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "# change into the directory where you extracted the materials, into the python-jupyter folder\n",
    "\n",
    "cd C:\\Users\\Alexander\\Documents\\meetup-notes\\python-jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "# make sure you have the corrent conda / python environment activated (indicated by the brackets at the begiining of the command prompt)\n",
    "# start the jupyter notebook server\n",
    "(py34) jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should get a website opening that lists you README files and the 3 folders (which you might already have seen, as you made it here : -) ).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# What To Do now \n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains a curated collection of Jupyter Notebooks of \n",
    "introductory materials about programming in Python in general, the Pandas data manipulation and visualisation toolkit, \n",
    "and the Geopandas geospatial library.\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository aims at different degrees of experience with the Python programming language and Python data manipultation and visualisation libraries.\n",
    "Each folder contains a `README.md` (for the the online repository) and `README.notebook.md` (readme as readable Notebook) \n",
    "file that list the contents and some details for each of the 3 big modules here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 01 - Introduction to Python and the Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "* 02 - Introduction to the Pandas library\n",
    "* 03 - Introduction to the Geopandas library\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the `README.notebook.md` in the base folder and now take directions to the linked working notebooks and lessons from there (which you probably did, because you are here right now :-) )\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topic 01: Python in a Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The folder [01-intro](./01-intro/) (Link to the [01 README.notebook](./01-intro/README.notebook.ipynb)) contains notebooks that are intended to aid both students and teachers in learning and teaching \n",
    "Python programming, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more details, the goals of this module are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Introduce students as quickly as possible to the basics of Python programming;\n",
    "- Introduce best practice as early as possible, while remaining accessible to students with no background in programming at all;\n",
    "- Provide teachers an easy-to-use material about programming in Python to be used in their lectures\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topic 02: Geospatial data wrangling with Geopandas\n",
    "\n",
    "[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) is a Python library for doing\n",
    "data analysis. It's really fast and lets you do exploratory work\n",
    "incredibly quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The folder [02-pandas](./02-pandas/) (Link to the [02 README.notebook](./02-pandas/README.notebook.ipynb)) contains a module that gives you some concrete examples for\n",
    "getting started with pandas. The [docs](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)\n",
    "are really comprehensive. However, I've often had people\n",
    "tell me that they have some trouble getting started, so these are\n",
    "examples with real-world data, and all the bugs and weirdness\n",
    "that entails.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topic 03: Geospatial data wrangling with Geopandas\n",
    "\n",
    "The folder [03-geo](./03-geo/) (Link to the [03 README.notebook](./03-geo/README.notebook.ipynb)) contains Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate the use of the Geopandas library. \n",
    "http://geopandas.org/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "GeoPandas is an open source project to make working with geospatial data in python easier. \n",
    "GeoPandas enables you to easily do operations in python that would otherwise require a spatial database such as PostGIS.\n",
    "GeoPandas extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types. Geometric operations are performed by shapely. \n",
    "Geopandas further depends on fiona for file access and descartes and matplotlib for plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to install the Geopandas python library and two libraries that we use to read and write from Excel-Spredsheets.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "(py34) conda install -c conda-forge geopandas\n",
